# Demo of sending/receiving messages to a STOMP server
#
# Tested with ActiveMQ

import stomp
import time



sent = "hello world: " + str(time.time())
c = stomp.StompClient()
c.connect()
c.send('/queue/campaign', sent)
c.disconnect()

c = stomp.StompClient()
c.connect()
c.subscribe('/queue/campaign')
got = c.receive(1)
c.disconnect()


Sent message: {{ sent }}
<br />
{% if got %}
    Got message: {{ got.body }}
{% else %}
    No message received.  Maybe another client read it?
{% end %}
